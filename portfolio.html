                    <h2>DiceBag</h2>
                    <P>A web app designed to augment the traditional table top RPG gameplay. User is able to create custom dice and have them saved locally in the browser.
                        the app handles the rolls from there with a simple click of the dice. I thought this would help speed up combat and other time consuming parts of
                        Dungeons and Dragons where math needs to be done on the fly and often times can lead to mistakes being made and time wasted. This was a project I did
                        for myself and for fun off to the side while attending UT's Fullstack bootcamp.

                        Bootstrap was shown as a much faster way to get a uniform clean look without needing to stylize everything by hand.
                        A faster way to prototype and get a project off the ground, and that much closer to being a real product.

                        The data structures ended up becoming cumbersome, and didnt allow for easy scaling and creating more rooms.
